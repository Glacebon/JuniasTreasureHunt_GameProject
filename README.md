### Metropolia University of Applied Sciences
# Junia's Treasure Hunt

A group project for Metropolia's game design course. Assignment was to create a game prototype during the course, with the help of a Unity tutorial as a basis or from scratch. Our team chose to build our game from scratch. This is in no way a finished, polished product.
